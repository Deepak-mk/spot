**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I’ve built a production-ready **Agentic Analytics Platform** that goes beyond simple text-to-SQL by implementing a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) architecture** with strict enterprise guardrails.

I am pleased to share the deliverables below.

### 🚀 Live Application
You can access the live platform here:
🔗 **[INSERT_DEPLOYED_URL_HERE]**

> **Note on API Usage**: The backend is powered by the Groq Cloud API (Free Tier). It supports ~14,000 requests/day, which is ample for testing. Please avoid heavy automated load testing to prevent rate-limiting.

### 🔐 Access Credentials
*(Sent separately via [LinkedIn/Portal/Secure Email] for security, as per best practices).*

### 📄 Attached Documentation (PDFs)
I have attached the following reports to give you a full 360° view of the system:

1.  **Whitepaper_Report.pdf**: The complete technical story (Proposal, Architecture, Data Model, User Manual).
2.  **Evaluation_Scorecard.pdf**: Automated regression test results proving **100% accuracy** and safety compliance.
3.  **User_Manual.pdf**: A quick-start guide for the end-user.
4.  **Technical_Deep_Dive.pdf**: Detailed engineering decisions (Vector Store, Semantic Layer, ReAct Loop).

### ✨ Key Differentiators to Look For
When testing the application, I encourage you to try:
*   **The "Thinking" Process**: Expand the *"🧠 Agent Thought Process"* block to see the agent planning its steps in real-time.
*   **The "Shield"**: Try asking about *"Politics"* or *"Democrats vs Republicans"* to see the **Vector Guardrail** block the concept without keyword matching.
*   **The "Brain"**: Ask for *"earnings"* instead of "revenue" to see the **Semantic Layer** handle business jargon.

I look forward to discussing the architecture and my design decisions in the next round.

Best regards,
