# 🚀 Agentic Analytics Platform (Enterprise Edition)

**"The AI Analyst that doesn't just talk, but acts."**

This platform is a production-grade **Agentic SQL System** designed to bridge the gap between natural language questions and enterprise data warehouses. It features a robust governance layer ("The Joystick"), a self-improving feedback loop, and deep observability.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 1. The Agentic Core
*   **Zero-Shot ReAct Loop**: Autonomously plans and executes analysis steps.
*   **Context-Aware Memory**: Inherits data results across conversation turns (e.g., "Compare that to Q2").
*   **RAG-Powered**: Retrieval Augmented Generation ensures 100% schema accuracy.

### 🛡️ 2. The Joystick (Governance)
*   **Kill Switch**: Instant manual or automated system halt.
*   **Cost Budgeting**: Hard stops at daily dollar limits (e.g., $10/day).
*   **Policy Guardrails**: Regex-fenced read-only access (No `DROP`/`DELETE`).

### 🔄 3. Self-Learning Feedback Loop
*   **RLHF-Lite**: Thumbs Up/Down interface for user feedback.
*   **Few-Shot Injection**: Automatically converts positive examples into prompt context for future improvement.

### 📊 4. Deep Observability
*   **Metrics Panel**: Real-time Cost ($), Latency (ms), and Query Counts.
*   **Structured Logs**: DataFrame-based log viewer with filtering and sorting.
*   **Traceability**: Every action is linked via a unique `trace_id`.

### 🏗️ 5. Semantic Abstraction
*   **Semantic Layer**: Decoupled schema logic aimed at future integration with **Cube.js** or **dbt**.
